My final graduate project. Attempting to find links between US partisanship from 2016 election, mask adherence, distancing adherence, Twitter sentiment, and COVID-19 rates.

Work was originally inspired by this paper: Gollwitzer, A., Martel, C., Brady, W.J. et al. Partisan differences in physical distancing are linked to health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nat Hum Behav 4, 1186â€“1197 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-020-00977-7
